Later on, when talking about it, his friends and biographers were noting that Bowies performances were ‘like something from another planet.

After multiple unsuccessful tries joining with various local bands, David has tried to embark5 on a solo career. Hes taken his alias inspired by James Bowie, an american pioneer who has also invented a bowie knife. This try was not very successful as well. Nevertheless, Bowie persisted relentlessly6, recording his own music, building up his network of contacts in the music world, and educating himself in various theatrical arts.

The real fame came to him after his song Space Oddity that was released as a single on July, 11, 1969, a mere few days before the fateful Apollo 11 launch. The song was inspired by Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey which was released just a year before that. The single quickly climbed to the top five in the UK charts. The song became one of Bowie's signature songs, while its hero, Major Tom, eventually became a recurring7 character in his other songs.

Fairly antagonistic by nature, he nevertheless managed to record another of his iconic albums, The Man Who Sold the World. Around this time he also started to develop many different colourful stage personas and build his stage appearances in-character according to those personas. Wearing provocative costumes and makeup, he and his projects swiftly came to the light of the media and he started gathering a cult following.

His acting talent has also caught the attention of various film and stage directors, sparking his acting career. While he never got any notable lead roles, he was a very convincing actor nevertheless, and often appeared in an important supporting role or as a cameo. His most noteworthy performances in this field include Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre rendition9 of The Elephant Man, and Phillip Jeffries, an enigmatic FBI agent from David Lynchs movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.

Bowie has struggled with drugs in his young years, but eventually managed to get rid of his addiction. In his late years he was a major advocate of healthy lifestyle. He has also used his fame to send strong statements regarding equality and the need to stand up against racism.
